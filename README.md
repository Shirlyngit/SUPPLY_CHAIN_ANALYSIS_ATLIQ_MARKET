## Project Overview

- This project aims to resolve AtliQ Mart's customer retention challenges by enabling real-time tracking of key supply chain metrics through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

### Data and Metrics

Data Sources: 
* Historical order data including order dates, delivery dates, quantities, and customer targets.

### Metrics Analyzed:

1. **On-time delivery (OT) %:** Percentage of orders delivered on or before the expected delivery date.

2. **In-full delivery (IF) %:** Percentage of orders delivered with complete quantities.

3. **On-time in full (OTIF) %:** Combined metric indicating orders delivered both on time and in full.


## Insights Extracted:

- Performance Trends: OT, IF, and OTIF percentages for each city and customer.

- Problem Areas:

1. Identified specific customers and cities with below-target OTIF percentages.

2. Highlighted recurring delivery delays and incomplete orders for certain products.

3. Target Comparison: Visualized gaps between actual performance and targets.


## RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Focus on Underperforming Regions: Prioritize service improvement in cities with low OTIF percentages.

2. Improve Logistics: Optimize delivery routes and warehouse operations to enhance on-time performance.

3. Strengthen Customer Communication: Collaborate with key customers to understand specific concerns and set realistic expectations.

4. Regular Monitoring: Use the dashboard’s daily updates to swiftly address service issues and track improvement efforts.
